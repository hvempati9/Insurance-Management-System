# Insurance-Management-System
 
I have created a Insurance Management System where users can purchase multiple policies under multiple insurance types like car, vehicle, travel under one umbrella.
The front end is designed using JFrame and backend is designed in Oracle DB.

Special features of this application:
1. Admin Insights dashboard: In this page, admin can see the trending policy name, number of users using this application, number of policies sold.
2. Verify Users: After the user registers on this application, admin will verify the user then only that user will be able to buy policy on the application.
3. Bill Printing: After buying the policy from this application, the bill will get printed in pdf version.
4. Change Profile Details: Users can change security question and password.

In this application we are performing multiple DB operations like Insert, Update, Delete, Select.

The admin credentials to run this application is as below:
Username : admin@gmail.com
Password : admin
